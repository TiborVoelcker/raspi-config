# OpenThread Border Router - the Thread half of the smart home. It owns the
# 802.15.4 radio and bridges the mesh onto the LAN; Home Assistant drives it
# over a REST API and does the commissioning, so there is nothing to configure
# here beyond pointing it at the right dongle and interface.
#
# Follows https://openthread.io/guides/border-router/build-docker, with two
# departures:
#   - upstream's host prep is a curl-pipe-to-shell (`setup-host`); it is four
#     sysctls, so they are written out below instead
#   - the radio is found through /dev/serial/by-id rather than hardcoded to
#     /dev/ttyACM0, which is allocated in USB probe order and moves
#
# The container appends its own ip6tables/NAT64 rules to the HOST firewall on
# every start - host networking plus NET_ADMIN. They accumulate across
# restarts; a reboot is the cleanup.
